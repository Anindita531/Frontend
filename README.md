# 🎨 Frontend Projects by Anindita

Welcome to my collection of frontend projects built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. Each folder contains a standalone app with its own setup and features.

## 📂 Projects

- [🌦️ WeatherApp](./WeatherApp)  
  A React-based weather app using `useEffect` and Tailwind CSS.

- [✊ Rock Paper Scissors Game](./RockPAperScissors)  
  A fun interactive game built with React and custom styling.

## 🚀 How to Run

Each project has its own `package.json`. To run any app:

```bash
cd ProjectFolder
npm install
npm run dev
